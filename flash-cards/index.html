                        What is the difference between var, let and const?

                    <p class="answer desactive">
                        var is function-scoped and hoisted. let and const are
                        block-scoped. let can be updated, while const cannot be
                        re-declared or updated.

                        What's the difference between `==` and `===`
                    </p>
                    <p class="answer">
                        `==` (loose equality) compares values after type
                        coercion, while `===` (stricty equality) compares values
                        and types without coercion

                    <p class="answer">
                        The JavaScript engine moves declarations (but not
                        initializations) to the top of their scope during
                        compilation.

                        A function that retains access to variables from its
                        outer scope even after the outer function has executed.
